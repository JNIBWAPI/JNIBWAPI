To get 64-bit compilation working, I used:

Boost 1_40_0
 Edited bootstrap.bat:
   line 12: call .\build.bat vc9 > ..\..\..\bjam.log
   line 9, 16, 18: replace ntx86 with ntx86_64
 Then ran bjam with the command (in boost dir using VS2008 x64 cmd prompt):
 > bjam address-model=64 toolset=msvc-90 --with-thread
 Also added the BOOST_ROOT as an environment variable

CGAL-3.5.1 windows installer, (chose 64 bit during installation)

CMake 2.8 for windows. Command executed (from CGAL dir using VS2008 x64 cmd prompt):
 > "C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake 2.8\bin\cmake.exe" -G "Visual Studio 9 2008 Win64" .
