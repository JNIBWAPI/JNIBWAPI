The folder:
jnibwapi/dependencies/AMD64/dll
must be added to the PATH environment variable (or placed in another folder on the PATH) for 64-bit execution to work.
These are the 64-bit equivalents to the ones BWAPI puts in the Windows directory.

Alternatively, use 32-bit execution by specifying a 32-bit java.exe in run.bat
