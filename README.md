# JNIBWAPI

Build a [Starcraft](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/sc/) AI in Java!

This project provides a Java interface for the Brood War API ([BWAPI](http://bwapi.github.io/)), using Java Native Interface ([JNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface)) to communicate over a shared memory bridge. This allows Java developers to write AI for Starcraft, one of the most popular [Real-Time Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy) games, and participate in AI competitions (see links below).
